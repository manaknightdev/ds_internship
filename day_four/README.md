Task 4
We want to test your research ability.

We have 20 pictures of motherboards with memory.
We have 20 pictures of motherboards without memory.

We want to make a simple flask api where we upload image or choose a hardcode image and can draw a box around the different memory. So if there 2 memory, we draw 2 boxes. If only 1 memory, draw 1 box only.

Which algorithm you will use? Why you choose this? Does CPU or GPU have an impact on your decision?

What if given a video instead of images? Does your approach change?

We suggest using https://www.makesense.ai/ to annotate.
